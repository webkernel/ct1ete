I will begin a new approach on my hamradio blog. I will publish some of the bad practices Iâ€™ve been observing on the amateur bands. The [DX Code of Conduct](https://www.m0oxo.com/dxcode-of-conduct.html) is something every ham operator should follow.

In the picture, you can se a station jumping into another one that was replying the DX station. This was during a pileup on the 80m band.

What will that station benefit from this bad practice?
