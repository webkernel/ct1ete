Since January 21st, 2018 recognized as new DXCC entity, Kosovo's first sounds came from Z60A's DX'pedition. The international team consisted of DL3DXX, OH0XX, OH1MA, OH2BH, OH3JR, OZ1IKY, S50A and S51F, together with local stations Z61DX, Z61FF, Z61VB, Z62FB and Z63DBB.

Needless to say, the pile-ups were huge and I struggled to work them with only 100 watts and my longwire. However, almost always dedication and persistence pays off. I made 3 CW Q's in 3 bands (15/20/30).
