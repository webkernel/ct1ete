Alex, RD1AV, operates on the HF bands from Vostok base in Antarctica (RI1ANC). Vostok Station (Ста́нция Восто́к, in Russian) is a Russian research station located in the interior of Antarctica. It was founded on December 16 1957 and is currently shared by the Russian Federation, United States and France. It is located at 1,253 km from the South Pole and 1,260 km from the nearest coast.

I worked Alex on 20 meters, SSB and CW.
