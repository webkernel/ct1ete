![K1N](/images/navassabanner.jpg)
<br>
It’s on-the-air since February 1st. K1N is the long-awaited activation from Navassa Island, one of the top two DXCC entities of 2015, together with P5 – North Korea. Last time it was activated was in 1992. I am a Ham since 1993, so this one is my first opportunity to work this extremely difficult spot to visit, due to the fact that licenses to go to the island are very hard to get.

The website of the dx’pedition is at [http://navassadx.com/](http://navassadx.com/), where you can find lots of information about the operation, the island and the logistics.

Contacts to that part of the world are somehow easy from Europe. But signals aren’t as strong as one would expect. Propagation seems to be fair but not good enough to bring strong and stable signals to this end of the european continent.

Now, analyzing what has been my experience for about a week trying to work them (consider 100w and a longwire), I should say that K1N is not as easy as it gets! Why?

1. Propagation has been FAIR
2. Huge pile-ups
3. low-power and modest antenna
4. DQRM, police, lids
5. Being in South Europe means a different propagation pattern than the vast majority of the EU continent

Glad I worked them both on CW and SSB! All-time New One for me!

A few thoughts!

Where do we want hamradio to go?
Why are these lids ruining our beloved hobby?
