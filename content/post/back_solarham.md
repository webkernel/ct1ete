Founded in 2006 as a small spare time website, SolarHam has grown into a full time mission and hub for space weather followers around the world. Now set to turn 9 years old, SolarHam is routinely updated with breaking space weather news, many times hours before other Space News websites or blogs. You can trust SolarHam.com for up to date and accurate space weather information.
